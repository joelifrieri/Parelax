Parelax is a jQuery plugin that provides parallax scrolling on iOS.
===================================================================

Based on code originally by Francesco Bertelli (<a href="http://twitter.com/_ll_l">@_ll_l</a>), 
Parelax allows you to pass a few elements to a jQuery method to easily create Parelax scrolling.

It's very light, right now, but I plan on adding lots of optional features in the future,
including negative scrolling, horizontal scrolling, and callbacks for the the initial touch events.

For now, feel free to fork! Thanks so much!
